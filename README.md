This project is a front-end exercise based on the Calorie counter challenge from freeCodeCamp.
Initially, I focused on restyling the UI, then I expanded its functionality to transform it into a  comprehensive web application for tracking daily calories and calculating your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) with fitness goal adjustments.
