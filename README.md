This project is a front-end exercise based on the Budget Calculator challenge from freeCodeCamp.
Initially, I focused on restyling the UI, but the next phase will expand its functionality to transform it into a personalized calorie calculator.

Planned Upgrades:

BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) integration
-User input: Age, gender, weight, height, activity level.
-Formula Mifflin-St Jeor Equation

FITNESS GOAL CALCULATOR
- Output:  Daily Caloric needs
- Dynamic adjustments based on user goals (weight loss/gain/maintenance)
